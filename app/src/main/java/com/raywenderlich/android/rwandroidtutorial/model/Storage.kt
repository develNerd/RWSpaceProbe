    ProbeMission(
        "Cassini",
        "Cassini was one of the most ambitious efforts ever mounted in planetary exploration. A joint endeavor of NASA, ESA (the European Space Agency), and the Italian space agency (ASI), Cassini was a sophisticated robotic spacecraft sent to study Saturn and its complex system of rings and moons in unprecedented detail."

    ProbeMission(
        "ExoMars TGO",
        "The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (ExoMars TGO) is searching for methane and other trace gases in the Martian atmosphere that could be evidence of possible biological or geological activity."
    ),
    ProbeMission(
        "The twin Voyager 1 and 2",
        "The primary mission was the exploration of Jupiter and Saturn. After making a string of discoveries there — such as active volcanoes on Jupiter's moon Io and intricacies of Saturn's rings — the mission was extended. Voyager 2 went on to explore Uranus and Neptune, and is still the only spacecraft to have visited those outer planets. The adventurers' current mission, the Voyager Interstellar Mission (VIM), will explore the outermost edge of the Sun's domain. And beyond."

    ProbeMission(
        "James Webb Space Telescope",
        "The James Webb Space Telescope – sometimes called JWST or Webb – is NASA’s largest and most powerful space science telescope. It is a premier observatory with a large infrared telescope that has an approximately 6.5-meter primary mirror"

    ProbeMission(
        "Lucy",
        "Lucy is the first space mission launched to study the Trojan asteroids. Trojans are small bodies that are remnants of our early solar system. They orbit the Sun in two loose groups: one group leading ahead of Jupiter in its orbit, the other trailing behind."
